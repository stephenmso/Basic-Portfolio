                    Hi, I'm Stephen. I am a data scientist and analyst. Previously I studied Statistics and Computer Science at Duke University. I graduated in the spring of '18. Since then I have been looking for full-time work in an analytical role.

                <p>
                    Beyond my technical work I also enjoy eating pizza, taking photographs with my DSLR, playing and listening to music, driving, staring out the windows of various vehicles, staring into the windows of various vehicles, spending time with loved ones, petting furry animals, going to the movies, cleaning my room, then making it messy so I have to clean it again, and coming up with more random hobbies so I can make this paragraph larger. I wish I had more to say, but since this is just a preliminary template with fake forms and a fake portfolio, it'll do for now.
